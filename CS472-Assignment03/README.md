## Description ##  
A server named Marvin which responds to HTTP/1.1 request on port 80.
Named after the depressed robot/android from the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy.
Marvin may add headers to let you know how he is feeling if I have time to implement that.

## Language ##
Java 10

## Usage ##
I'll need to figure that out sometime 
Probably just run Marvin program and then send http request

## File Structure ##
Leave the error html files in the same directory for best results please
